                        Clark Gable, famous for his role as Rhett Butler in <span className='movie_title'>"Gone with the Wind"</span>, owned this estate with his wife Carole Lombard during the 1930s and 1940s. Known as the <i>"desert hideaway"</i>, the property boasts many luxurious amenities typical of the era, including sprawling gardens, a large swimming pool, and expansive views of the San Jacinto Mountains.

                        Located just a couple of hours from Los Angeles, Palm Springs offered a convenient escape from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. It provided a serene retreat where stars could unwind and enjoy a more private lifestyle within the tranquility of the desert.

                <p>"We love a good pink house, but a rosy-hued home that once belonged to one of Hollywood's dreamiest actors makes us especially giddy. It's like the real-estate equivalent of a strapping gentleman in a pink polo shirt â€” oddly, it just works.</p>

                <p>And it's rife with perplexing famous-people details, like half a dozen bathrooms, a saltwater pool, and a guest house cutely called a <i>'casita'</i>. But, exposed wooden beams, intricate tilework, and a master bedroom with outdoor access make this house a timeless classic (much like Gable himself)."</p>
